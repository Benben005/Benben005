My name is Ben, and I am excited to have the opportunity to introduce myself. I am a female product manager with a strong passion for technology and a deep interest in expanding my skills in database-related technologies and code development.

Throughout my career as a product manager, I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver successful products. I have gained valuable experience in understanding user needs, defining product requirements, and driving product strategy. However, I believe that having a solid foundation in database technologies and coding will greatly enhance my ability to design and develop innovative products.

In my spare time, I have been actively immersing myself in learning about databases and coding. I am eager to explore various database management systems and gain hands-on experience in database design, querying, and optimization. Additionally, I am excited to delve into coding languages such as SQL and Python to develop efficient data-driven solutions.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to connecting with all of you. Let's embark on this exciting journey of learning and growth together!
